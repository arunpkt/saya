                    <p>
<p>Throughout the Universe diverse creations in countless forms along with the oceans, Mountains, flora and fauna thrive b a Divine Order of Destiny.  These mortals are happy or sorrowful as per their "KARMA" and as ordered by primordial force the "ADI SHAKTHI"</p>
<p>As per Cosmic order SHE apportions our life with shares of happiness and anguish.  A study of ancient scriptures and writings of Astrology clearly reveal the cosmic plan that the Omnipotent "Devi" orders these dispensations not directly but only through the Navagrahas.</p>

<p>As such with the thought of the Great Guru in heart, as ordained by the karma of the founder trustee Shri G.K. Murthy, Journalist Artist began this world's wonderful exciting but exacting task of building this temple.
Quarter of a century ago the vision of the Great Saniswara who appeared in his Mind's Eye Egged him on to ask the Sage of Kanchi, the Paramcharya of Kamakotipeetam whether he could launch his project appeared in his vision.  Before he could proceed further he had the answer from the Mahaswami of kanchi.  He smiled and told him "you are trying to achieve the impossible but you have the blessings of Sri Sarvesvara and you will achieve your goals.  You will realise your dream in due course but wait a little and then you will get the help from Government and the public."  The Swamiji blessed him and gave him Tulsi and Nagalinga flower with his sacred hands.</p>
<p>Out of the nine planets it is the Lord Saturn who is the Natural Giver of Gifts or otherwise and He is the only  "Ishvara"  among the nine.  When the Lord Saniswara is on top, you go up in your ladder of fame, but when he climbs down naturally you are pulled down also.  This is the order of the Global Divine Plan.  The Jothisha Shastras give clear indications of the masterful Power of the Saturn.</p>
<p>When people are caught in his web of fate it will be in their interests to worship the all-powerful Lord Saturn in an Idol form.
In the Entire celestial our country Bharat holds the key to spirituality.  It has the prime of place in this Globe.  Due to huge increase in population and other complication, our trials and tribulations have increased to an intolerable degree.  The only way out of this is to worship the Navagrahas for succour.</p>
<p>Talking of the powerful Lord Saturn all the astrological indices point to the fact that He is as generous as He could be cruel.  As an evidence of this fact our attention is invited to the sufferings of Emperor Nala and Pandava Brothers.  When such great souls suffered under the spell of this Iswara what about us, mere mortals?</p>
<p>"Though we have myriad of prayers and hymns eulogising Lord Saniswara, there seems to be no separate Temple for this Lord or any correct description of Him.  As such after going through various ancient texts the founder presumed a figure for Sri Sanishwara.</p>
<p>In today's Kali age, many people may be able to do Pooja, Japa, Homa with gifts, Parayana etc., but quite a few may not be able to afford this.  Perhaps many may not be able to adopt correct Shastric procedures through a proper Guru.</p>
<p>Only with this public welfare in view, the founder carefully drew up the Sacred Portrait of the all-pervading Lord Saturn. In addition to this he also intended to construct a special temple for the first time in the World for Lord Saniswara by the munificence and sincere co-operation of the people like Messrs Naidu Hall.  We have in this context various plans and he requested all large hearted friends to lend a helping hand to this very noble cause and get the Blessings of Lord Saniswara.</p>
<p>He therefore entreated everyone of this strife torn world to worship the sacred feet of Lord Saniswara and attain solutions to their problems and get the ultimate bliss.</p>
<p>TO LIVE IN PEACE AND PROSPERITY-PRAY �LORD SANISVARAN�
Lord. Sanisvaran Saturn is very powerful as a planet of the celestial astrological planets on his own � self and is an indispensable force � which by his presence control the ups and downs, in a person's life in proportion to "Karma" done by the person.  In the Astrological publications of North India, Eagle is mentioned as the carrier of Lord Sanisvaran.   An eagle's piercing eyes, majestically looks and its swift action have made it, the king of birds, and this might be the reason for the Northerners to portray it as the carrier for Lord Sanisvaran.</p>
<p>In the idol of Lord Sanisvaran he is adorned in a yellow garb as yellow is an auspicious colour.  He is sitting on an eagle; he is arched in the form of a bow.  His look is pensive, with a smiling face and his appearance attracts one and all.  We feel confident that his bow.  His look is pensive, with a smiling face and his appearance attracts one and all.  We feel confident that his blessing will not go in vain.  By actively participating, in the construction of this unique temple, disciples can be assured that their troubles caused by Lord Sanisvaran will be set right. Lord, Sayaputhiran as he is also called Sri. Sanisvaran Bhagavan's statue as well as portrait has been brought out after a careful religious study of the features incorporated in it.  The copyright for this statue as well as portrait is exclusively owned by the Trust. Nobody has any claim over them.</p>
<p>In the South Indian temples, crow is depicted as carrying Lord Sanisvaran and it is worshipped as such.  But it is a wrong perception, as our Vedic Sastras mention that the crow is representative of activities relating to death ceremonies.  This aspect is not common knowledge.  This has eroded the fruits of our sincere worship of Lord Sanisvaran even though we abide by the scriptural injunctions for such worship.  A human being is indeed a wonderful creation, soul is ever present and it is inextinguishable.  Only, human beings have values of Pava -Punniya.  Why is it so?</p>
<p>How did we get our birth?  If we ponder seriously, we will understand that we have been through many births.  Our after one�s death to commemorate his memory.  We are still sincerely following such rites prescribed in our religious texts.  Does any other living being on earth, other than human, observe such rites after life's end?</p>
<p>Only for humans, we have every year religious rituals like death anniversary of the departed ancestors, etc., the present day scientific world has also not denied the other world or life after death!  Each religion has its own way of observing death anniversaries.  The so called self-respect ideologists have also not denied about the life after death.  Based on this aspect, we come to a conclusion that the dead have some sort of life even after their end.
Life on earth and beyond is positively controlled by some divine force this we have to accept whatever may be the name and wherever people worship formless god and accept all worship.  As mentioned by our ancestors, there is some formless magnetic power which goes around the world!  As an apt example we can take the presence of electricity around the world, we can utilize it for our use only after necessary processing in an Electric Power House!</p>
<p>Similarly, God who is omnipresent can be reached only through a place of worship-Temple, Church, Mosque etc.  This aspect cannot be denied.  A person, who is above caste, religious, and creed affiliations, becomes a great reformist.</p>
<p>Many persons are under the false assumption that they are the most intelligent and capable of superior actions in the world and that none others can be compared with them.  They also indulge in all well planned evil acts and feel that none will know about their evil deeds.  With this false presumption, they dream of supreme position and live a bogus life!  Every person has a cycle of 30 years of bad and good life.  And it�s his own making and this cycle of 30 years is always there.  He experiences all good aspects of life for 30 years and in the next 30 years he has a bad cycle (Viyalla Vattam).  Due to his crooked ideas, even a person who is good at heart, has evil thoughts.  And it rises often to harm others, Godliness is absent in a person with a crooked heart.  If Godliness is there in a person's heart, all evil thoughts and bad ideas are absent.  Men and other celestial persons (like Devas and others) have to face the consequences of their evil deeds through their close kith and kin and friends.  This is ordained so and nobody can escape.  It is Lord Sarvamangala Sayaputhiran (Lord Sanisvaran) who is responsible for the punishment to the evil doers through their relations and others.  However great and mighty a person may be, for all evil acts.  Punishment and repentance are only through Lord Saniswaran! People should understand this aspect and act accordingly and give due respect to Lord Saniswaran at all times, both during good and bad periods.
India has its own unique important place as a religious country in the world.  Welfare of the world citizens, brotherhood among all religious classes in the universe with a broader outlook to unite all of them has been the prime duty of all the old sages and philosophers of our country.  Thus the founder observed".</p>
<p>It will be an unique temple in India, adhering to all religious directions Agama Sastras followed for  constructing a temple it will be built with donations from India and abroad.  It will be a place of worship without any reservations of caste, creed and religion.  It will be a place of worship for one and all.  It will be built in vast area.

                <h1>Lord Shani Bhaghavan - Well Wisher A Kalpavriksha</h1>
                    <div class="big_img">
                        <img src="images/about_us1.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>All we know that Shani Bhagavan is the Son of Lord Sun and the most powerful Graham in the jury of others grahams. Despite this we do not know one thing i.e., he is incarnation of Vishnu and he is the soul of the Universe.
In Addition to this all we must know that He is a devotee of Lord Shiva.
In order to acquire more power than his father He goes to kashi to offer worship to Lord Shiva upon His father's suggestion (Sun). Lord Shiva is pleased with Shani Bhaghavan's devotion and dedication and bestows upon him his blessings, Lord Shani Bhaghavan asks him for two boons. One is he wants to be more powerful than his father and the other is he should be  seven times more distant from the sun and surrounded by seven sub grahams. Lord Shiva grants him these boons and bestows blessing on him. 
Shani Bhaghavan is the Chief controller of the whole Universe. All living beings are bounded to the chains of our Karmas and have to undergo their good and bad results. </p>
<p>Generally people have misconception about Shani Bhaghavan. These are all due to fear people have with him. People are frightened of him, possibly that is why Lord Shani Bhaghavan is named as a cruel, a rude and a malefic grahams. However, it certainly does not mean that Lord Shani Bhaghavan has any scarcity of love and kindliness.</p>
Being the lord of the house of Karmas and Justice, in the horoscope of "Kalpurush", it justifies our karmas. In order to calculate "Mahurta", in Astrology, the rays of the grahams and their Nakshatra lordships are also calculated. These rays have good and evil properties and thus their effects do change with the passage of time. Only specific rays of the Planets and the Nakshatras, have special qualities and matter, as per their transitory position. To perform a particular work successfully, we choose auspicious "Mahurta". It is very much clear that the tradition of finding the "Mahurta" is not merely a superstition or a blind faith, but it is completely scientific and secretive. Horoscope reflects the nature and the character of a particular person. An astrologer reveals the bare facts of the various phases of the life of a native. The Astrological science analyses the facts of the present and the past life of a person and encourages him to put more efforts in performing his duties righteously. Lord Shani Bhaghavan being the signifier of our actions (the present as well as the past) has the capacity to do undo the evil results of our past deeds with suitable present remedial measures.</p>
 <p>The "Supreme Power" Lord Shani Bhaghavan is responsible to regulate this Universe and to control all living beings. The Shani Bhaghavan decide all the joys and sorrows to all living beings including the human beings. However, this is a separate issue that we attain these joys and sorrow due to our own destined karmas. Hence, the most important role of Lord Shani Bhaghavan, as a signifier of our present actions, cannot be ignored at all. The decision regarding, "When and how the results of the deeds of pre-births are fructified by the nine planets" among which Lord Shani Bhaghavan plays the most significant role. Lord Shani Bhaghavan is the chief Justice and punishes or rewards the human beings according to their misdeeds or good deeds. Lord Shani Bhaghavan is neither partial nor delays in granting the punishment for evil deeds. The reason being that Lord Shani Bhaghavan does not show any sympathy while punishing. He threats them through evil results enriches them makes them famous and known through granting good results. </p>
<p>Generally Shani Bhaghavan decides the effects of the deeds of our previous births, in our present lifetime. </p>
<p>Our ancient seers and sages have studied the malefic and benefic effects of Lord Shani Bhaghavan very minutely and described the same in our classical books in great details. </p>
<p>Lord Shani Bhaghavan punishes only those who are involved in ill deeds. However, he becomes happy and favorable to people performing good deeds and rewards them with lots of progress in their life and may also elevate them to high positions like secretary, minister and even sometime up to the rank of Prime Minister. At the same time, when Shani Bhaghavan gets annoyed, he also grants imprisonment to such people of high position and they have to face various types of humiliations depending upon their misdeeds.</p>
<p>It is clear that Lord Shani Bhaghavan delivers the result of our deeds without any favour or animosity. He should not be considered as grahams that grants only pains to the living beings. On the other hand, by doing so he nullifies the effects of his misdeeds and makes the living being pure and devoted towards the Divine. Thus, Lord Shani Bhaghavan is always a well wisher and is very similar to a Kalpa Vriksha (Tree that fulfills the desires). If people know His real character   they will not be afraid of him, instead they start worshipping Him without any fear. </p>
<p>Having known the real picture of Lord Shani Bhaghavan, one should start worshipping him without any fear. People should follow the truthful path, thereby making Lord Shani Bhaghavan all happy. This will enable them to experience thyself and thereby enjoying the pleasures, the worldly and the heavenly. We must remember that the blessings of Lord Shani Bhaghavan can only be achieved by performing good deeds and through his blessings, our prayers bear fruits, resulting into the speedy experience of the Almighty. 
When we think seriously, it becomes crystal clear that this era is the era of the favouritism & bribery. In this modern age, only those who are tolerant to other's ill-deeds, are praiseworthy, irrespective of their post & position. They are successful in every phase of life. </p>
<p>There is no scope for any bribery, flattery or the "Right of Might" in the court of Lord Shani Bhaghavan. Here you have to accept and experience the results of your deeds, good ones or the bad ones. Believe me, it's only the Lord Shani Bhaghavan who is capable enough to deliver such results. All other grahams merely support him in owing his duties and they all deliver their effects only through Lord Shani Bhaghavan.</p>
<p>As per the common natural law, any sect has the hereditary effect upon its successors. Lord Shani Bhaghavan is not only related to Maharishi Kashyap but is also his grandson and is the son of Lord Sun. This makes him wonderful and endows upon him, a matchless personality. It is not only due to this reason that Shani Bhaghavan preaches the path of divinity even by becoming a servant to human beings whenever required, and no doubt, these are his hereditary qualities.</p>
